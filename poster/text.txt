Abstract:
  Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are rapidly becoming the de-facto development platform for hardware and ASIC designs. Specifically, designs in computer architecture such as microprocessors may be rapidly created, iterated upon, and verified without the need of interacting with hardware until the final stages of the development cycle. This project is an open microprocessor platform using the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).
