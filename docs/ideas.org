* Pipeline
** Try to remove stalling
Forward data through pipeline with additional register + multiplexer
Do bubble similar to ECE399 computer.

* Cache Scheme
** 2-way set assoc.

** Also try for a Victim cache?
Fully associative, small, holds evicted blocks from main cache.
Intended to reduce conflict misses.


* Branch Prediction
** 2-level Adaptive
LSB Branch addr => correlation register pattern

Correlation register = previous branch outcomes pattern

Correlation register pattern => entry in Global pattern table

Entries in GPT may be shared by any correlation register pattern.
*** Pro
Reasonable hardware, lower than others such as correlation-based.

** Bimodal
Address of branch instr (LSB) = index into global table of prediction bits
When branch outcome is known, table entry is updated.
*** Pro
Cheapest hardware
