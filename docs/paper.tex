\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-1}
This project is a 4-stage pipeline, Reduced Instruction Set Computer-5 (RISCV) with branch prediction and a dedicated caching mechanism. 

\section{Part Choice}
\label{sec-2}
For this project, I will be using the DE0 nano Development and Education Board as the main development platform. With approximately 22,000 Logic Elements, this board will have no problem synthesizing the CPU.

\section{Implementation}
\label{sec-3}



\subsection{Pipeline}
\label{sec-3-1}

\subsubsection{Instruction Fetch}
\label{sec-3-1-1}
In this stage, the program counter is updated based on either a branch, or simply incremented. From here, the new instruction is looked up based on that counter value.
\subsubsection{Instruction Decode}
\label{sec-3-1-2}
Here, the instruction from memory is decoded. In this stage, the register file is 'primed' for

Main memory will use the SDRAM on the 

\subsection{Cache}
\label{sec-3-3}
The caching scheme that will be used will be a 2-way set associative cache. This method extracts the last bits from the LSB as a tag to perform a lookup for the specific data, associated with that tag. If it is found, it is a cache hit and can be returned, if not, it is a cache miss and the pipeline must wait on the SDRAM, in this case main memory, to retrive the piece of data.

\subsection{Branch Prediction}
\label{sec-3-4}
Branch Prediction is generallly used within a RISC pipeline to mitigate a pipeline flush which
